# colorwheel.js
Dynamic color wheel in Javascript. A rewrite of https://github.com/McIntireEvan/colorwheel

This is a HSV-based colorwheel written in JavaScript

It relies on jQuery, and only works in browsers that support <canvas>

As of right now, it is two files, but in the future, it'll only need the colorwheel.js file

More documentation coming soon
